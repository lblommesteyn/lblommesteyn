# PCBGolf: what the numbers actually say

Tooling and measurements for [commaai/PCBGolf](https://github.com/commaai/PCBGolf).
Everything below is measured from the repo files by the scripts in `tools/`, not
recalled. Score is the official one:

```
score = PCBA bounding-box volume (mm^3) + 50 x vias + 5000 x copper layers
```

## 0. What the repo actually contains

Parsing `pcbgolf.kicad_pcb` (`tools/pcb.py`):

| property | value |
|---|---|
| copper layers declared | 2 (`F.Cu`, `B.Cu`) |
| track segments | **0** |
| vias | **0** |
| zones | **0** |
| `Edge.Cuts` geometry | **none** — there is no board outline |
| footprints | 245, all on the front |
| pads | 1078 |
| nets (from the schematics) | 297, of which 196 have 2+ pins |
| connected pins | 1053 |

So the repo is **a schematic plus a rough placement, not a finished board**. There
is no reference score to beat and no reference routing to improve on: every
entrant draws the PCB from scratch. The `.kicad_pcb` carries no netlist either —
connectivity exists only in the five `.kicad_sch` sheets, so `tools/netlist.py`
rebuilds it geometrically (wire/junction/label/power-symbol union-find). It
resolves **1053/1053 pins onto wires, 100% hit rate**, which is the check that
the netlist is right.

## 1. The exchange rates that decide every other choice

This is the single most useful thing to internalise. At a board height of
Z = 7 mm (see §3):

| you spend | it costs | equivalent to |
|---|---|---|
| 1 via | 50 pts | **7.1 mm^2 of board area** |
| 1 copper layer | 5000 pts | **714 mm^2 of board**, or 100 vias |
| 1 mm^2 of board | 7 pts | |
| 1 mm of height (at 1300 mm^2) | 1300 pts | 26 vias |

Two consequences that run against normal PCB instinct:

* **Vias are expensive.** A 400-via board spends 20,000 pts on vias alone —
  more than its entire volume. Via-averse routing (pours on the outer layers so
  pads connect without a via, power as fat outer-layer traces) is worth more
  than shaving millimetres off the outline.
* **Going 2-layer only pays if it costs fewer than 200 extra vias.** That is a
  tight budget for a board with a USB hub, 4 CAN channels, SDMMC and ~50 GPIO.

## 2. Fine-pitch BGA is a *losing* move here

This inverts the obvious "shrink the MCU" advice. The reference MCU is an
STM32H725ZGT (LQFP-144, 20x20 mm, measured courtyard **23.3 x 23.3 = 543 mm^2** —
43% of all component area on the board). ST also sells the same die in
LQFP100 (14x14), VFQFN68 (8x8), TFBGA100 (8x8), UFBGA169 (7x7) and
WLCSP115 (3.75x4.15).

| package | courtyard | area saved vs LQFP100 | escape vias | via cost | net |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LQFP-144 (stock) | 543 mm^2 | -287 mm^2 | 0 | 0 | baseline |
| **LQFP-100 14x14** | **256 mm^2** | — | **0** | **0** | **best** |
| TFBGA100 8x8 (0.8 mm) | 72 mm^2 | +184 mm^2 = 1288 pts | ~36-64 | 1800-3200 | **-500 to -1900** |
| UFBGA169 7x7 (0.5 mm) | 56 mm^2 | +200 mm^2 = 1400 pts | ~110 | 5500 | **-4100** |
| WLCSP115 (0.4 mm) | 20 mm^2 | +236 mm^2 = 1652 pts | ~115 + HDI | 5750 | **-4100** |

A BGA would only win if Z were above ~17 mm, and it is 7. **LQFP-100
(STM32H725VGT6) is the right call** — same die, same 1 MB flash, 82 GPIO against
the 50 the design actually uses, zero escape vias, and no HDI cost at JLCPCB.

Pin-usage evidence (`tools/nets.py`): of the LQFP-144's 144 pads, **40 are
single-pin nets (unused)**; 42 are power/ground and ~50 are real signals.
Moving to LQFP100 needs pin remapping (PF11, PG9, PG10 are not bonded out on
LQFP100), but FDCAN3 is also mapped to PD12/PD13 which *is* available, and the
rules explicitly allow firmware changes.

## 3. Z is floored by the barrel jack — not by the USB-C ports

Measured from the STEP models (`tools/step_bbox.py`) and footprints:

| part | footprint | height above board |
|---|---|---|
| `DCJACK_2MM_SMT` (PJ-002AH-SMT) | 15.65 x 9.40 | **~9 mm — tallest part** |
| `USB-C-FEMALE-VERT-GCT` x4 (OBD-C) | 8.93 x 5.80 | 8.80 mm (**vertical mount**) |
| `2X04` CAN header | 9.90 x 4.82 | ~8.5 mm |
| everything else | | <= 3.2 mm |

The four OBD-C receptacles are **vertical**: the cable plugs in perpendicular to
the board. Swapping them for ordinary horizontal or mid-mount USB-C receptacles
(identical mating interface, 3.26 mm body) takes them off the Z critical path —
but they get *deeper* in XY (9.2 mm vs 5.8 mm), so it is a genuine trade, not a
free win.

The real floor is the DC jack. A 5.5 mm OD barrel plug needs a 5.5 mm bore, so
the receptacle body cannot be much under 6.5 mm in its smallest dimension, in
any orientation. Mid-mounting it in a board cutout puts the barrel axis on the
board plane, which makes **Z ~ 7.0 mm** and — critically — gives ~2.7 mm of free
height on *both* faces. Every other part fits inside that, so
**double-sided assembly becomes free in volume terms.**

That is the single biggest structural win available, and it is why the optimised
placement below is ~44% smaller in area than the stock one.

## 4. Free BOM wins found by reading the design

| what | from | to | saves |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCU package | LQFP-144 (543 mm^2) | LQFP-100 `STM32H725VGT6` | **287 mm^2** |
| 4x current-sense op-amp | SOIC-8 `NCS20071SN2T1G` (40 mm^2 ea) | SC-70-5 `NCS20071XV5T2G` | **131 mm^2** |
| 125 R + 40 C | 0402 | 0201 | **~210 mm^2** |
| 13 bulk caps | 0805 | 0603 | **~25 mm^2** |

The op-amp one is the funniest: the schematic symbol is literally named
**`NCS20071XV`** — the SC-70 variant — but the fitted MPN is `NCS20071SN2T1G`,
the SOIC-8. Same die, 5.5x the area. Four of them.

Also found, though not directly exploitable: the **USB2517 is a 7-port hub using
only 5 downstream ports** (DN1-4 for the OBD-C ports, DN7 for the STM32; DN5/DN6
are unconnected). There is no single-chip 5-port USB 2.0 hub, so cascading two
4-port QFN24 hubs is the only way to shrink it, and it saves ~50 mm^2 at the cost
of an extra hub tier — roughly a wash. Keep the USB2517.

## 5. Measured placements

`tools/gridpack.py` is a legal-by-construction placer: connectors are seated on
the perimeter with their mating face outward and become obstacles, then every
other part is dropped into the lowest-leftmost free cell on either board face via
an integral-image free-region test. Output is always overlap-free, so it can be
handed straight to a router. Ordering, rotation, board side, and connector edge
assignment are annealed against `W*H*Z + lambda*HPWL`.

| BOM | tightest legal board | Z | volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| stock | 42 x 36 mm (1512 mm^2) | 10.6 mm | 16,027 mm^3 |
| optimised | **36 x 36 mm (1296 mm^2)** | **7.0 mm** | **9,072 mm^3** |

See `placement_stock.svg` / `placement_opt.svg`.

A hard constraint worth knowing: the eight connectors need **~74 mm of board
edge** between them. That alone floors the outline at roughly 20x20 mm however
small the electronics get.

## 6. Ideas that did *not* survive contact with the numbers

* **Folded flex PCB.** Proposed as the moonshot; it is not worth it. The 74 mm
  connector-edge requirement floors the footprint anyway, folding *adds* stack
  height against a 7 mm flat envelope, a 4-layer FPC pays the same 20,000 pt
  layer penalty, and the assembly risk is severe. Killed.
* **BGA MCU.** Net negative by 500-4100 pts (§2).
* **Dropping to 2 copper layers.** Only wins under a 200-extra-via budget (§1) —
  possible but unproven; see the routing experiment.
* **Using plated through-hole pins as free layer transitions.** Real but tiny:
  only the connectors have TH pins.

## 7. Where the score actually goes

With the optimised 36x36 mm, Z=7 mm board:

| term | value | share |
|---|---|---|
| volume | 9,072 | 23% |
| 4 copper layers | 20,000 | 50% |
| ~200-400 vias | 10,000-20,000 | 27% |
| **total** | **~39,000-49,000** | |

**Half the score is the layer count, and most of the rest is vias.** Volume —
the thing the challenge is named after — is the smallest term. Anyone optimising
purely for a small outline is fighting for the least valuable 23%.
